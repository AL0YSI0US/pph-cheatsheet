  **So happy you have found me, and hopefully found us in the future!**

  This demo and code base is just to illustrate how to approach learning any new tool or technology in general. We show case how to scrape a website that I had approval to do so on, and more importantly are here to show how Puppeteer can be used in tandem with Node.js to scrape data from websites. With a few added features just for fun.
